# InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a high-performance time series database designed for storing and analyzing time-stamped data. It's perfect for marine applications where you need to store and query sensor data from Signal K and other marine data sources.

## Features

- **Time Series Optimized**: Purpose-built for time-stamped data
- **High Performance**: Fast writes and queries for large datasets
- **SQL-like Query Language**: Familiar syntax for data analysis
- **Built-in Web UI**: Intuitive interface for data exploration
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic data lifecycle management
- **Continuous Queries**: Real-time data aggregation
- **Grafana Integration**: Seamless integration with Grafana for visualization

## Marine Use Cases

- **Sensor Data Storage**: Store data from GPS, depth sounders, wind sensors, etc.
- **Performance Analysis**: Track boat speed, fuel consumption, and efficiency
- **Weather Logging**: Record environmental conditions over time
- **System Monitoring**: Track battery levels, tank levels, and engine parameters
- **Historical Playback**: Analyze past voyages and conditions

## Default Configuration

- **Web Interface**: Port 8086 (HTTP)
- **API**: RESTful HTTP API on port 8086
- **Data Storage**: Persistent volumes for database files

After installation, access the InfluxDB UI at `http://your-device-ip:8086`.

## Integration with Signal K

InfluxDB works seamlessly with Signal K to store marine sensor data:
1. Install Signal K Server
2. Install InfluxDB (this app)
3. Enable the Signal K InfluxDB plugin
4. Configure the plugin to point to `http://localhost:8086`
5. Your marine data will automatically be logged to InfluxDB
